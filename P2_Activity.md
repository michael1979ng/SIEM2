Yes, it would have alerted the SOC Analyst of the suspicious logons.
No, it is set appropriately for the hourly settings, it would have also triggered an alert for the activity for the second hour from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. on the same day.

Dashboard Analysis for Signatures with Bar, Graph, Pie Charts
Does anything stand out as suspicious?
No
Do the results match your findings in your time chart for signatures?
All Charts are showing the same information as above for the Signatures.
Dashboard Analysis for Users with Bar, Graph, Pie Charts
Does anything stand out as suspicious?
No
Do the results match your findings in your time chart for users?
All Charts are showing the same information as above for the Users.
Dashboard Analysis for Users with Statistical Chart
What would be the advantage/disadvantage of using this report, compared to the other user panels you created?

There is only one advantage of the stats chart, as it will only give the total count of the users activity or the percentage of the activity. However, the disadvantage of the stats chart compared to a chart will show a cumulative perspective, while a time chart shows the suspicious activity over a more specific, and shorter time frame.
